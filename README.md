## Introduction
The project aims to provide insights into Spotify's music trends by analyzing song attributes and their impact on popularity. This exploration focuses on data preparation, visualizations, and trend analysis to understand genre, artist, and musical characteristics associated with popular songs.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for analysis.
- `data/`: Contains the Spotify dataset (`SpotifyFeatures.csv`).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the *Spotify Features* dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db), containing song attributes like genre, popularity, danceability, energy, and more.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: Basic plotting
- **Seaborn**: Enhanced data visualizations

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and clean it (e.g., handle missing values, ensure consistency).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Generate descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand popularity distributions.
3. **Genre-based and Artist Analysis**:
   - Calculate average popularity scores across genres and identify top-performing artists.
4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Analyze relationships between musical attributes (e.g., danceability, energy) and popularity.
5. **Attribute-based Analysis**:
   - Study the impact of key and time signature on popularity, along with other attributes like mode and acousticness.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations, such as:
- **Histogram**: To display popularity score distribution.
- **Bar Plots**: For top genres and artists based on popularity.
- **Heatmaps**: Correlation analysis of attributes influencing popularity.
- **Box Plots and Scatter Plots**: To explore the relationship between musical attributes and popularity.

## Results
1. **Popularity Distribution**: Most songs have popularity scores between 30 and 50.
2. **Genre and Artist Analysis**: Certain genres like Pop and Hip-Hop are more popular, and some artists consistently have high popularity scores.
3. **Attribute Impact**: Attributes such as danceability, energy, and valence strongly correlate with popularity.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into which musical characteristics contribute to the popularity of songs on Spotify, offering valuable information for artists, producers, and music enthusiasts.

## Limitations and Future Work
This analysis does not consider external factors (e.g., marketing, release timing) that might affect popularity. Future work could include machine learning models to predict song success based on its attributes.
